                <p>The town of Jaffna, or Yaalpaanam as it is locally known, with its fascinating mix of colonial charm and Tamil culture is situated in the northernmost peninsula of Sri Lanka.
				Surrounded by the Indian Ocean and the Jaffna lagoon, this part of the country is a wonderful place to visit if you want a holiday with a difference. Jetwing Jaffna offers luxuriously comfortable accommodation in the form of 55 deluxe bedrooms.
				Elegantly furnished in a culturally contemporary style, the rooms are large and airy, with magnificent views of the town. The main restaurant which can seat 100, features a wide variety of local and international menus. Serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, the restaurant provides traditional Jaffna and South Indian food as well as a host of Asian,
				Western and Mediterranean meals. In addition, the hotel is next to a Cargills supermarket,
				complete with food court, movie theater, bank (including an ATM) and a fuel station. Combining traditional Sri Lankan hospitality with impeccable service, and only 5 minutes away from the Jaffna railway station and city center,
				Jetwing Jaffna is the ideal venue for your business or leisure trip.</p>
